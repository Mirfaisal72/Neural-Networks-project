# Fashion MNIST Neural Network Project
Welcome to the Fashion MNIST Neural Networks project! In this project, we utilize the TensorFlow and Keras libraries to create a neural network model that classifies clothing items from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The goal is to explore the capabilities of neural networks in recognizing various fashion items and to showcase the synergy between technology and fashion.

# Introduction
Fashion MNIST is a dataset of grayscale images representing 10 different classes of clothing items. This project demonstrates the process of loading, preprocessing, building, training, evaluating, and predicting using a neural network model.

# Dataset
The Fashion MNIST dataset contains training and testing sets of grayscale images, each labeled with a class. The classes include:

0 - T-shirt/top
1 - Trouser
2 - Pullover
3 - Dress
4 - Coat
5 - Sandal
6 - Shirt
7 - Sneaker
8 - Bag
9 - Ankle boot
# Data Preprocessing
The pixel values of the images are scaled to a range of 0 to 1 to enhance the model's performance.

# Model Architecture
We build a sequential neural network model with layers:

Flatten layer (input layer) - Flattens the 28x28 image to a 1D array.
Dense layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation.
Dense layer with 10 neurons (output layer) using softmax activation for multi-class classification.
# Training
The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function over 10 epochs.

# Evaluation
The trained model is evaluated on the test dataset to calculate loss and accuracy.

# Prediction
The trained model is used to make predictions on test images, and the probability distribution over the 10 classes is displayed.

# Conclusion
This project showcases the implementation of a neural network to classify fashion items using the Fashion MNIST dataset. It provides an example of how to build, train, and evaluate a model for image classification tasks. Feel free to modify and expand upon this project to explore more advanced techniques and improve model performance.
